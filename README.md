# First Portfolio

## Description

As a coding student, I want to create a portfolio to show to potential employers. The skills used to make the portfolio demonstrates my ability to grasp the concepts we have covered in class. It can also be a file that I look back on to compare my progress in the future. It can hold any projects that I complete throughout my coding experience.
